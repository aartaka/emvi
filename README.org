#+TITLE:Emvi: trying to do Lisp in Vi (not Vim!)

POSIX/BSD vi is extremely primitiveâ€”no colors, no language modes, no plugins.
But still, using it is a nice exercise in minimalist text editing.
That's what I, as a Lisp programmer, am trying to do, preferably without going insane.
This .exrc config file is an attempt to reproduce the functionality of fancy Lisp-friendly systems.
Like Emacs and Paredit.
In vi.

* Getting started
Just copy/symlink the .exrc to your home directory and start vi.

#+begin_src sh
  git clone https://github.com/aartaka/emvi
  ln -s emvi/.exrc ~/.exrc
#+end_src

Here are the bindings I've added:
- C-x s :: Save changes.
- C-x b :: Edit the previous/alternate file.
- C-x k :: Exit.
  - C-x K :: Exit without saving changes.
- C-x f :: Edit a new file.
- C-x . :: Jump to a tag/source. Use =ctags=-compatible solution (likely [[https://github.com/universal-ctags/ctags][Universal Ctags]]) to generate a tags file for your Lisp codebase and use it to navigate around.
- C-x x :: Jump to matching paren/bracket/brace.
- C-a ( :: Add empty parentheses and insert right into them.
  - C-a [ :: Same, but for square brackets.
  - C-a { :: Same, but for curly braces.
  - C-a " :: Same, but for double quotes.
- C-x ( :: Wrap the current symbol into parens (=paredit-wrap-round=).
  - C-x [ :: =paredit-wrap-square=.
  - C-x { :: =paredit-wrap-curly=.
  - C-x " :: =paredit-meta-doublequote=, but without the internal quoting.
- C-x ) :: Slurping the next symbol into the current parenthesized form.
  - C-x ] :: Same, but for square brackets.
  - C-x } :: Same, but for curly braces.

* Thanks
- Thanks to Vasily Gerasimov for the name idea.
- Thanks to Arch Linux forums for giving me [[https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/73299.html][pointers on how to fix tag support]] in vi.
